# Scriba – Chrome Extension

A lightweight Chrome extension that rewrites selected text into a professional, human-like email using OpenAI.

I often found myself rewriting emails to sound clearer and more polished. It helped me understand how Chrome extensions work and how to integrate APIs like OpenAI.

## Features

- ✅ Rewrites selected email text into a more professional tone  
- ✅ Clean, minimal popup UI with a copy button  
- ✅ Works on Gmail and similar mail platforms  
- ✅ Fully self-contained and privacy-friendly (no tracking or logging)

## How to Install

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in your Chrome browser.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top right corner).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extracted project folder.
5. Go to Gmail or any webpage, select some text, then click the extension icon.
6. The rewritten version will appear in the popup — click **Copy** to use it.

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand:
- Chrome extension structure: background scripts, content scripts, and popups  
- Extracting and manipulating selected text on live web pages  
- Designing intuitive micro-interfaces  
- Calling and managing external APIs like OpenAI  
- Learning through small, practical experiments
